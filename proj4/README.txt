The makefile was built using the example that Prof showed in discussion

The CSVWriter and CSVTest were implemented from discussion example too.


//steps for using googletests

brew install cmakeâ€©
cd googletest
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..            //from build ->> make sure to do the ..
make //from build
then make changes in the makefile
// the make sure you exit the googleTests directory before pushing anything to git



//Things to do:
1. fix makefile to work with main.cpp
2. Finish XMLReader
3. Write tests for A) XMLReader B) CSVReader C) CSVWriter
4. Finish main.cpp



//Before Submission
1. do make clean before pushing anythin to git or doing any Submission
2. from inside proj4 in the command line do "rm -rf googletest"
3. update timeslots any time is good for me, you decide :)
